Cricket Tournament – Highest Run Scorer

A cricket academy wants to reward the player who scored the highest number of runs in a tournament.

Write a Python program to identify the highest run scorer using reduce() and a lambda expression.

Input
players = [
    ("Virat", 78),
    ("Rohit", 102),
    ("Gill", 89),
    ("KL Rahul", 65),
    ("Iyer", 91)
]
Expected Output
Highest Run Scorer: Rohit'''
from functools import reduce
players = [
    ("Virat", 78),
    ("Rohit", 102),
    ("Gill", 89),
    ("KL Rahul", 65),
    ("Iyer", 91)
]
result =  reduce(lambda x,y:y if x[1]<y[1] else x,players)
print(result[0])
