2. Factorial of a Number
In project scheduling, tasks are dependent on previous tasks, and the total number of ways to arrange them is calculated using factorial. Factorial of a number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n.
Write a program to calculate the **factorial of a given number using loops**.

Input: n = 5
Output: Total Ways = 120 '''

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
fac = 1

for i in range(n,0,-1):
   fac = fac*i
print("Total ways = ",fac)
