1. Electricity Department Billing System


The electricity department of a city wants to automate the monthly bill generation process for its customers. The bill is calculated based on slab-wise unit consumption:

* First 100 units are charged at ₹5 per unit
* Next 100 units (101–200) are charged at ₹7 per unit
* Units above 200 are charged at ₹10 per unit

Write a Python program to calculate the total electricity bill based on the number of units consumed.

Input:
Enter units consumed: 250

Output:
Total Electricity Bill: ₹1700
'''
units = int(input("Enter units consumed: "))
bill =0
 
for i in range(1,units+1):
     if i<=100:
         bill = bill+5
     elif i>100 and i<=200:
         bill = bill+7
     else :
         bill = bill+10

print(f"Your bill is {bill}")
