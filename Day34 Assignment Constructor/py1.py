'''Question 1: Employee Salary Management System
Scenario

A company wants to automate employee salary calculations. The HR department needs a system that calculates the gross salary of an employee by including allowances.

Requirements

Create a class named Employee with the following attributes:

employee_id
employee_name
basic_salary

Initialize the values using a constructor.

Calculations
HRA = 20% of Basic Salary
DA = 15% of Basic Salary
Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + DA
Sample Input
Enter Employee ID : E101
Enter Employee Name : Rahul Sharma
Enter Basic Salary : 50000
Sample Output
------ Employee Salary Details ------
Employee ID      : E101
Employee Name    : Rahul Sharma
Basic Salary     : 50000.0
HRA              : 10000.0
DA               : 7500.0
Gross Salary     : 67500.0
