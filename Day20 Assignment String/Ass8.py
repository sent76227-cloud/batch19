Find the Second Highest Repeating Character in a String

Social Media Trend Analysis System

A social media company analyzes hashtags and user comments to identify trending character patterns.

The analytics team wants a Python program to find the character with the second highest frequency in a given string.

This helps detect secondary trending patterns in user activity.

Input:

aaabbbbccddeee

Output:

e

Explanation:

b occurs 4 times → highest
e occurs 3 times → second highest

Condition:

Program should work for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Spaces should be ignored.
If no second highest frequency exists, print:
Second highest repeating character not found

s = input("Enter String: ")

highest = 0
second = 0
high_char = ''
second_char = ''

for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == ' ':
        continue

    count = 0

    for j in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[j]:
            count += 1

    if count > highest:
        second = highest
        second_char = high_char

        highest = count
        high_char = s[i]

    elif count > second and count < highest:
        second = count
        second_char = s[i]

if second == 0:
    print("Second highest repeating character not found")
else:
    print(second_char)
