'''1. Sum of First N Natural Numbers
A teacher wants to reward students by giving points daily. On day 1, a student gets 1 point, day 2 → 2 points, and so on. This follows a natural number sequence.
Write a program to calculate the **total points earned after n days** by summing all natural numbers up to n using loops.

Input: n = 10
Output: Total Points = 55 '''

n = int(input("Enter number: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
   sum = sum + i
print("Total Points = : ",sum)
