8. Count Multiples of 5 Between Two Numbers
A supermarket gives coupons to customers whose token numbers are multiples of 5. The manager enters a token range and wants to know how many eligible token numbers exist.
Write a program to count numbers divisible by 5 between two given numbers using loops.

Input:
1 20

Output:
Count = 4 ''' 

num1 =  int(input("enter a num1: "))
num2 = int(input("enter num2: "))
count = 0

for i in range(num1,num2+1):
   if i%5==0:
     count = count+1
print("count = ",count)
